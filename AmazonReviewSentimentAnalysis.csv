0,"I am using this controller for Sous Vide Cooking & I love it.  It has proven to do the job very well.  I protect the temperature probe from the water by using a length of 3/8"" soft copper tubing which is pinched and soldered shut on the bottom end.  That allows the probe to sense the temperature without a lag.This unit has allowed me to experience Sous Vide cooking at a low cost because I use it in conjunction with an ordinary 7 quart crock pot.  I gave it four stars only because the instructions are not user friendly.  To help others I have posted photos of the interior mechanism on whysousvide.com.  The photos clearly show where the jumpers are and how to move one of them to use it to control a heating unit rather than a refrigerator.  It's quite simple once you know how.  I also like the long wires as they allow plenty of room to move things around on the counter top.I highly recommend it.",I am using this controller for Sous Vide Cooking I love it It has proven to do the job very well I protect the temperature probe from the water by using a length of soft copper tubing which is pinched and soldered shut on the bottom end That allows the probe to sense the temperature without a lag This unit has allowed me to experience Sous Vide cooking at a low cost because I use it in conjunction with an ordinary quart crock pot I gave it four stars only because the instructions are not user friendly To help others I have posted photos of the interior mechanism on whysousvide com The photos clearly show where the jumpers are and how to move one of them to use it to control a heating unit rather than a refrigerator It s quite simple once you know how I also like the long wires as they allow plenty of room to move things around on the counter top I highly recommend it,0.028,0.128,0.844,0.9463,False,True
1,"I use this to keep my beer nice and cold inside of a chest freezer. This thing works like a charm.I initially had it simply sitting in the freezer, but I soon realized that the beer was warmer that I needed it to be. I figured out that measuring the air temperature was not the way to go.I wrapped the temperature probe in plastic and submerged it in a bottle of water so that it actually uses the temperature of the liquid instead of the internal air temperature. This allows me to regulate the temperature of the freezer by how cold the liquid is, not how cold the air is.The way that it controls the temperature is by allowing the unit to switch on when it rises above the desired temperature and completely cutting off the electricity when it reaches or falls below the set temperature.

2,"I purchased this control as an alternative to the stc-1000 controllers that are popular. By the time I would have purchased the stc, along with a project enclosure, switch, fuse, cords, strain relief, I would have had almost as much into it as this unit which was all ready to go. Plus, I would have needed to build it. I needed fahrenheit scale, which this controller has. The directions are written in native english, not chinglish, so are easy to follow. Set up is simple. Two screws open the housing. Then you place the jumper in either the heating or cooling position. You can choose settings easily by hitting ""mode"", and scrolling to the correct parameter with the arrow buttons. You can set temp differential, anti short-cycling time, pre cut off/cut in temps, and of of course cut in and cut off temps. I have this unit hooked up to an ultrasonic cleaner to control its tank heater, and it works really well. The enclosure has four keyhole type screw holes/slots in the back for mounting. This might not apply to you, but keep in mind this is not designed for washdown applications, i.e. it's not water proof.

4,"I've been using the Johnson controller for years to convert a chest freezer to a fermentation chamber. I use it year-round for fermenting sake, lagers, and in the summer, ales - so anywhere within the 47-65 degree region.

The probe cord is thin enough to allow me to simply slip it over the edge and shut the lid. I haven't found a need to drill a hole.Be mindful that the probe can give off misleading temperatures if it comes into contact with the walls of the freezer or refrigerator. Also the air at the bottom will always be cooler. I arrange the probe so that it comes into contact with the side of my bucket or carboy at  mid-height.I also set the temperature closer to the top of the temperature range (for an ale that prefers temperatures between 62-67, I'll set the controller for 66 or 67.

5,"The first thing you have to do when you get this thing is to open it up and change the jumpers around a little bit, so that it measures heating and not cooling.  This is literally like a 5 minute process.  One or two screws on the back, then both jumpers on.  Check the instructions though.After changing the module from cooling to heating, you have to find something to plug into the temperature controlled outlet.

6,"Actually my husband, Michael wrote review:  I have a family heirloom '34 GE Monitor Top fridge running methly formate as the refrigerant.  I remember the unit running as a beer fridge in the 60's in my parents barn.  by the 70's it was relagated to winter paint storage as my dad said it wouldnt run any more.  Brought the fridge to my house where a friend, an HVAC tech, got it running and porcelain cleaned and painted monitor top  for me. Original compressor works with no leaks.  On/off switch would not work, no biggie thats what electrical  plugs do also.  The temp control would turn the compressor on and off but would not vary temps, compressor would stay on for 2 hours or so and cool down to about 30 F in the box, compressor would not come back on till temp hit around 42 F no matter how much I  tried to regulate the temp control settings.  My HVAC buddy was afraid to try to convert the controls due to the old frail  wiring and lack of knowledge about the antique. Restoration companies want thousands of $$$ to convert these things to modern freon, controls etc.I read and researched  about the Johnson unit and figured if it worked could make this MT a reliable 2nd fridge and working conversation piece.  Since I already had a small investment in it another $75 was worth it to try.  Ordered the unit, delivered in about a week during the Chritmas holiday and I had the unit plugged in to set up the control parameters on Dec. 31st.  on New Years day I  installed unit and passed the probe cable through the door molding to test the product. used a piece on thick pliable plastic tubing around cable as to protect the probe cord when the door closed... the MT door is like a vault door and can do a lot of damge to someting caught in between unlike flimsy modern fridge doors.  Hung the probe taped  about halfway down in the box. MT has very small freezer with no door which is essentally the evaporator, since  am not using for a freezer the original temp probe contacting the outsde of the evaporator/ freezer will be overidden by the Johnson unt.  Also, the MT's do not have fans and doors to move air to cool the fridge box, all done by the heavier denser cold air falling down from the evaporator/freezer. The unit retained the parameters I had set the day before.... delay 12 minutes, cut in at 39 F and  cut out at 35 F.  After the initial cycle the unit holds cold 2-3 hours without cycling on again for 20 - 30 minutes to cut out point.  Ambient basement temp is around 65 F.  Instructions were EASY to follow for with even very little technical training.  This past Saturday I felt comfortable enough to drill a temperature probe sized hole through the back of the MT unit to install the probe the correct way.  Got the probe through the outside steel wall, the insulation and the inside steel (not plastic) wall after two attempts through the barely large enough drilled holes.  Siliconed the openings up outside and inside.  So far all is good.  Not afraid to keep  food, beer, pop etc now in this unit.I know this post is long winded but anyone with an old refigerator from the 20's or 30's etc that needs temp control knows how tough it is too find helpful info.

7,"This unit can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.Me? I wanted it to run an older kegerator that had a faulty temperature control. (Some say you shouldn't use this unit as I am, that repair is preferable. But after talking to a few refrigeration techs, using this to cycle it on and off is no different than having the built-in unit do it.) A few moments with the manual will let you know how to set it up. The set-point is the high-end temp, and the differential can be set from there. It defaults to cut out after the differential is reached. For instance, if the set-point is 40 degrees, and differential is 5, it will kick on at 40, and off at 35, so figure your target temperature within that range.And it's a breeze to tweak until you get it set to where you want it.My only con, and it's a small one, is the somewhat large diameter probe wire. I didn't want to drill into the kegerator, so I ran the wire under the door seal. However, while there was a small leak, some foam from a window AC unit plugged it up easily enough.

16,"I was looking for something to moderate the temp of my beer fridge, since the little spinning dial / sliding mechanism didn't cut it.  The first thing I saw was temp controls, but they required electrical work and splicing wires.  Pass.Then I saw this, and it works perfectly.  You just plug it into your electrical outlet and then plug the fridge into this, and it turns it off and on based on the probe temp.If I had to complain about something I would say that the probe wire is a bit thick.

24,"I bought this item in October of 2010 and have used it for controlling fermentation temperature on several batches of beer since then to gain better control and more repeatability in the fermentation character of my beers. It is easy to use and I ferment ales and lagers alike using this controller in conjunction with a chest freezer. It still performs well and is a good no-fuss method for controlling ambient temperature during fermentation of my brew. I understand that some people have had issues where the temperature swings more than they would like. That does happen, but it's more a function of the cooling equipment (in my case my chest freezer) than the controller itself. It can be mitigated by leaving the chest freezer open or plugging in a fan as well as the freezer for circulation around the fermenter. Leaving the freezer lid open with no fan and set to 66F, the freezer will drop to 62F and slowly rise to 66F before kicking in again. The beer has so much thermal mass that I doubt it will actually experience the temperature wave, so in this case I would feel comfortable calling this 64F. If that setpoint is lower, say 47F for a lager, that swing is even tighter with the freezer door open, dropping to maybe 45F at its lowest point. I haven't had to worry about what temperature extremes my beer sees during fermentation since I've had this controller and could do lagers in the hottest months of the year.

84,"Like many others, I bought this item to create a cheese aging cage out of my small refrigerator and I agree with the fact that no matter how low the actual settings are, there is no way the inner temperature can get to the 54-58 F range which is what most aging cheeses ask for. You can buy a wine fridge, which I did ( a small one, but I overgrew it already), but the price tag for a decent size (say 3-4 cubic feet) starts with $200 so that is something I don't want to invest on. So, based on the good reviews I bought this item after using it for 2 weeks now here are the pros and cons that come to my mindPros:1-Well built quality and decent cord length (both the sensor and the powerline) so that you can hide the item at the back and still turn around the sensor and put it inside (better put it somewhere it stays without moving, I put my sensor into an empty salt dispenser and taped the dispenser's opening so that it does not get out easily. Then I put the dispenser on the fridge door (works fine for the moment)2- Accuracy in the temperature readings: I checked the temperature that shows on the thermostat and the temperature inside (using two different room thermometers) and see the difference with in 1F or less and that is due to the other settings I adjusted like the cut in and cut off temperature difference or so (if your target temperature is 54F this item gives you the option of the acceptable range. So you set, lets say, 2F difference in menu and whenever it is 56F then it lets the cooling and whenever the temperature hits 52 F it stops the current. (you have the option of setting this difference as low as 1F)3-Many additional features: One of them is the difference function that I explained above and the other one is the function to prevent fast compressor cycling. Most refrigerators use a compressor to function. It is not recommended to switch on and off the compressor in very short intervals (say less than a minute or so) or the compressor life expectancy fails. So this device lets you set the minimum compressor cycling time. This means that even if the temperature goes up or down the set temperature if the compressor has recently started working or shut down, it waits until the set time to pass before turning the compressor on/off again. I set mine to 2 minutes.Cons:Not many so far but if I must write a few words, I can say that the manual is ridiculously complex. You only need 1/3 of the information written on it. The descriptions target an electrician who wants to tear it into pieces and make it again from scratch. But that is nothing I can complain as long as I can dissect out the information I need to find.In terms of price: It is not ridiculously expensive but it is not cheap either. I would like it to be $10 cheaper but a $70-80 range can be considered as a fair price range.So for a home cheese maker, I recommend this product. But one thing to remind: Temperature is not the only thing that matters in cheese aging. A relative humidity of over 75% is what most cheese desire and this item does not help in that. So far, I am trying to kill the dryness inside the fridge by adding damp clothes, napkins or water jars but seems I need to work on it some more..",Like many others I bought this item to create a cheese aging cage out of my small refrigerator and I agree with the fact that no matter how low the actual settings are there is no way the inner temperature can get to the F range which is what most aging cheeses ask for You can buy a wine fridge which I did a small one but I overgrew it already but the price tag for a decent size say cubic feet starts with so that is something I don t want to invest on So based on the good reviews I bought this item after using it for weeks now here are the pros and cons that come to my mindPros Well built quality and decent cord length both the sensor and the powerline so that you can hide the item at the back and still turn around the sensor and put it inside better put it somewhere it stays without moving I put my sensor into an empty salt dispenser and taped the dispenser s opening so that it does not get out easily Then I put the dispenser on the fridge door works fine for the moment Accuracy in the temperature readings I checked the temperature that shows on the thermostat and the temperature inside using two different room thermometers and see the difference with in F or less and that is due to the other settings I adjusted like the cut in and cut off temperature difference or so if your target temperature is F this item gives you the option of the acceptable range So you set lets say F difference in menu and whenever it is F then it lets the cooling and whenever the temperature hits F it stops the current you have the option of setting this difference as low as F Many additional features One of them is the difference function that I explained above and the other one is the function to prevent fast compressor cycling Most refrigerators use a compressor to function It is not recommended to switch on and off the compressor in very short intervals say less than a minute or so or the compressor life expectancy fails So this device lets you set the minimum compressor cycling time This means that even if the temperature goes up or down the set temperature if the compressor has recently started working or shut down it waits until the set time to pass before turning the compressor on off again I set mine to minutes Cons Not many so far but if I must write a few words I can say that the manual is ridiculously complex You only need of the information written on it The descriptions target an electrician who wants to tear it into pieces and make it again from scratch But that is nothing I can complain as long as I can dissect out the information I need to find In terms of price It is not ridiculously expensive but it is not cheap either I would like it to be cheaper but a range can be considered as a fair price range So for a home cheese maker I recommend this product But one thing to remind Temperature is not the only thing that matters in cheese aging A relative humidity of over is what most cheese desire and this item does not help in that So far I am trying to kill the dryness inside the fridge by adding damp clothes napkins or water jars but seems I need to work on it some more,0.07,0.06,0.87,-0.767,True,False
